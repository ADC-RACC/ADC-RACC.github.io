    <h1>My Learning plan</h1>
    <h3>14/06/2024</h3>

    <h3>
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3><p>
Anything related to programming really. Might jump to cyber security and see where I can go from there.</p><p>
</p><h3>
A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h3><p>
I am very good at linking puzzle pieces in a sense. I plan to make a html, css, and javascript document with all I've learnt on it for future use.</p><p>
</p><h3>
What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3><p>
I'd love to work on my human skills in the second half of this course, and get back to, and surpass, my former knowledge in programming.</p><p>
</p><h3>
A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3><p>
I plan to get my sprints done by Friday, but I'm not going to stress myself out if I have to work Saturday and Sunday aswell. Stuff happens.</p><p>
I'll probably divide the sprints into 5 by the estimate time of completion and work on that day by day.</p><p>
</p><h3>
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h3><p>
I will manage myself to work productively by reminding myself that if I dont work productively, I cannot game as much, and I can't reward myself with subway cookies.</p><p>
</p><h3>
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h3><p>
When things are building up and getting to me I'll most likely reach out to my awesome family and just take a breather, maybe go for a hike or something.</p><p>
</p><h3>
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3><p>
I will commit myself to not seeking rewards as help, instead to reward myself with inner thinking and self validation.</p><p>
</p><h3>
A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h3><p>
To make an awesome course that allows me to learn and create with others. Like a web development minecraft server.</p><p>
</p><h3>
Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau</p><p>
commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3><p>
I call my Nana every Thursday at 12pm to see how she's going. Shouldn't be an issue but I'd like to keep that up when I can.</p>
