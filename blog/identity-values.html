      <p>
        When playing games I often know when I am going to lose, but I don’t
        stop playing, ‘cause giving up when the rest of your team is fighting

      <h3>A testimonial/feedback from someone:</h3>
      <p>
        “Well when we play Barotrauma (cooperative submarine alien game), you
        always seem to make good calls and put people to work when they’re not
        sure what to do.”

        When I turned 18 I received a framed list of what It means to be a man
        of the Clark family. I resonated a lot with it because it was what I was
        already doing haha.
