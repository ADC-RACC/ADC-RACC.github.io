      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3>re:24/07/2024</h3>
      <h3>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
        If I remember correctly I believe I got stuck on the Super flipflop. I
        used a bit of trial and error and research to solve my issues.
        Throughout the problem solving I felt very lost, but I learned that alot
        of problems I have, people before me also have had.
      </p>
      <h3>Did you elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>
        Nope. Most of my problems felt like a jumble and only recently in boot
        camp have things started to click.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel alot more confidently in present with psudocode, googling, and
        asking for help.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before bootcamp I was too stuborn to ask for help so I just spent a long
        time racking my brain. Next time I will ask for help when stuck haha.
