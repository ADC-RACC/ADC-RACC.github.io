      <h3>re:24/07/2024</h3>
      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I re-learned that my memory is very bad for words and names specificaly.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming are to help excell our teamwork and sense of community, in
        turn speeding up our learning and development.
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        With knowledge of the first three days of bootcamp, what surprised me is
        that no matter the age there are a load of same thinking.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Writing down what my deep thinking was. More like finding the words for
        what I was experiencing in my mind.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because in bootcamp we are coding in groups so knowing more about
        yourself can help you relate to others strengths and weaknesses.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        It doesnt feel like a waste of time for me because I learned things, and
        to me learning is never a waste.
